#1 Count how many lines there are in each file

find ../Data/ -type f -name "*.fasta" -exec wc -l {} \;

#2 Print everything starting from the second line for the E. coli genome

tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta

#3 Count the sequence length of this genome

tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | wc -m

#4 Count the matches of a particular sequence, "ATGC" in the genome of E. coli 
# (hint: Start by removing the first line and removing newline characters)

tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "ATCG" | wc -l

#5 Compute the AT/GC ratio. That is, the (A+T)/(G+C) ratio. This is a summary 
# measure of base composition of double-stranded DNA. DNA from different 
# organisms and lineages has different ratios of the A-to-T and G-to-C base 
# pairs. For example DNA from organisms that live in hot springs have a higher 
# GC content, which takes advantage of the increased thermal stability of the 
# GC base pair (google "Chargaff's rule").

echo $(tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "A\|T" | wc -l) / $(tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "G\|C" | wc -l) | bc -l
